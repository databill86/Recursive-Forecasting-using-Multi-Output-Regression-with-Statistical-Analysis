# Recursive-Forecasting-using-Multi-Output-Regression-with-Statistical-Analysis
This project aims to forecast the Median Selling Price (MSP) of houses in MA and NY states for 2 months based on 70 months of data using time series analysis in Python by using Multi Output Regressor on three traditional regression models Lasso, KNN and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Statistical analysis is also performed to understand the influence of different features on the target label (MSP). The data is collected from Zillow website.

All the data files are in the _Data_ folder and the _Submission_ folder has _Code_ and _Figures_ folder.

# How to Run #
Go to _Submission/Code_ folder and run _MA_run_me.py_ and _NY_run_me.py_ python scripts using the following commands: `python MA_run_me.py` and `NY_run_me.py`. These can be run in two terminals simultaneously.

# Results #
The forecasted labels, actual values and RMSE are printed on the console after the run finishes.
